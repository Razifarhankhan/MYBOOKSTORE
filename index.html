            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A good book has the power to change the way we think, talk and analyze
                things. There are numerous books written in several genres such as fiction, non-fiction, novels, drama,
                thriller, suspense, science-fiction, etc. Every book comes with its own unique perspective. If you are
                an avid reader, you will get to create your own perspective, one which will help you stand apart from
                others. Reading gives us an advantage of analyzing different environments which pushes our mind to be
                observant. Books help in developing presence of mind and observational skills, thus illuminating on the
                importance of books in our life. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">One of the great reasons that signify the importance of books in our
                life is that books act as our best friends. Friends are one of the most important parts of our life. We
                canâ€™t imagine our life without the companionship of a good friend. Similarly, a book is like a best
                friend that constantly inspires us to become the best versions of ourselves. Books enrich our mind with
                knowledge just like a good friend. We can learn a lot from books and they can help us in overcoming our
                failures as well as shape our minds.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Even as young children turn into adults, the importance of reading does
                not cease. It helps you become a better speaker and also helps in enhancing your writing skills. Reading
                helps us in giving our brain muscles a good exercise and prevents the possibility of lethargy. If one is
                in the habit of reading he/she will always be entertained and will never really need anyone to come to
                their rescue when they feel bored.</p>
